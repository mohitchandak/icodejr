# SV Codive

A Web App for real time code collaboration and discussion with audio conversation. Where multiple users can join coding sessions and discuss code in a live editing environment such that everyone's changes reflect on screen in real time while on audio conversation so that users can explain along.

## Summary

India is still in development. Internet Connectivity is fluctuating from time to time. For Presentation purposes, we have meet, Zoom but no platform where we can share live coding through audio explanation. Transferring audio takes less internet compared to video. So, we aredesigning a platform where a mentor can come and explain coding to students through audio while coding in a live code editor.
